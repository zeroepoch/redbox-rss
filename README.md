Redbox Rentals RSS Feed / Python Redbox API Library

The Redbox-RSS project contains a minimal python API library, for interacting
with a Redbox user account, and an RSS server that presents rental history. The
Redbox API library has minimal to no external dependencies and can be used
independent from the RSS server. The RSS server also serves as an example for
how to use the Redbox API library.
